### 👋 Hey there, I’m Michael Johnson.

I'm a Technical Lead guiding a full-stack engineering team building modern web apps with **Next.js**, **Node.js**, **Yarn**, and **Material UI**, deployed across **AWS** services.

While I’m currently leveling up my frontend skills, my roots are in production support—deep in **debugging**, **SQL**, and leading high-stakes outage calls. That experience honed my instincts for diagnosing issues fast and collaborating across dev teams under pressure.

Now, I’m embracing the full software development journey, driven by curiosity and a “jack of all trades, master of none” mindset. I love exploring new tech, solving messy problems, and growing alongside my team.

- 🧠 Currently learning: React patterns, frontend architecture, and design systems.
- 🛠️ Tech stack: Next.js, JavaScript, Node, MUI, AWS (ECS, Lambda, S3), SQL, Zsh.
- 🧩 Interests: Dev workflows, observability, resilient systems, and AI tooling.
- 🎯 Motto: Learn broadly, dive deep when it matters, and keep shipping.
